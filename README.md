This SRT is at a testingphase. Problems may occur and I would appreciate any feedback on that. If you face "weird/random" hp's during gameplay, like a value thats really high, but isnt adjusted to an enemy and wouldn't make sense in that scenario. In that case please message me with the HP that was returned at that moment and at what stage it had happened.


**INSTRUCTIONS TO ADJUST THE HP BARS TO THE OBS SOURCE**

```
1. Right click your OBS source where this page is in https://mysterion06.github.io/Biohazard1SRT/
2. Press Properties/Eigenschaften/Propiedades
3. Adjust your Width/Breite/Ancho to 450 (Usually its 800)
4. Press Ok
```
